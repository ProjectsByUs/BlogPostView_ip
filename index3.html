        <h2>1. Badminton Roots Belong To Ancient China</h2>
        <br />
        The origin of badminton dates back more than 2,000 years ago with the
        names battledore and shuttlecock. This age-old game which involves two
        players hit a feathered shuttlecock back and forth with a bat was a pass
        time game in England and many European countries. ‍"Does the history of
        badminton belong to China by anyways?" Well, some historians say that
        Badminton is a derived version of “Ti Zian Ji” the game popular with
        Chinese. In this sport, the players used their feet instead of racquets
        to hit the shuttlecock! How funny is that?‍ ‍
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <h2>2. Second Most Popular Sport Of The World</h2>
        <br />
        Football is the world’s most popular sport. Of course, everyone knows
        that. But did anyone know that Badminton is positioned right next to
        Football? There are many other things that people miss out from
        badminton history - This game is played regularly by roughly 220 million
        people around the world in Europe, Africa, Asia, and America. Most
        popularly in Asia.If you look Olympics as a tool to measure the
        popularity of a sport, then Badminton has proved itself in this domain
        too. It has been introduced into Olympics since 1992 and records say
        that 1.1 billion people actually tuned into their TV channels to watch
        the game. That's a cool thing to know! Isn't it?
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <h2>3. Feathers From The Left Wing Of A Goose</h2>
        <br />
        Badminton is all about this high-drag projectile "The shuttlecock."
        Within the rectangular court of Badminton, it is the position of this
        little feathered object which decides the win or lose of the game. So,
        you've got to know about the shuttlecock. Shuttlecocks get their insane
        speed because they’re made of only the left wings of geese. Why? Is
        something wrong with the right wings of the geese? Geese wings hold the
        physics of the sport. The 16 feathered shuttlecocks, when smashed into
        the air, spins clockwise only if the features belong to the left wing of
        a goose. But do the same with the right wing feathers of a goose and
        your shuttlecock rotates counterclockwise — which totally screws the
        game and the players.‍ ‍

        <h2>4. Origin Of The Name</h2>
        <br />
        If a sport you love has an unusual name, it is very common to wonder
        about - “where the word originated?” So, to know why badminton was named
        so, you need to dive into the badminton history. The name ‘badminton’
        resonated from Badminton House which was the Duke of Beaufort’s
        residence in Gloucestershire, England. This game was re-introduced and
        popularized at this house; therefore it was decided to name the sport as
        Badminton. Gloucestershire now houses the International Badminton
        Federation.

        <br />
        <h2>5. Tougher Than Tennis</h2>
        <br />
        Badminton history proves that the game is tougher than Tennis. Oh! Man!
        Only if you are ready to burn some sever calories, you want to get into
        this sport. Otherwise, you can find your way out to grab some fish and
        chips; and be among the spectators of the game. Let’s get the facts
        cleared - A badminton player runs an average distance of 3.7 miles to
        take his/her shots in the singles game. On the other hand, a tennis
        player runs an average distance of 1.8 miles which concludes that
        badminton players travel twice the distance than that of the tennis
        players. ‍So, stamina plays a significant role in this game. Phew! Hats
        off to the world’s fastest racket sport, which requires quick reflexes
        and over the top energy levels.
