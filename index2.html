        Sports are all forms of competitive physical activity that aims to
        utilize, maintain or enhance physical ability and skills through casual
        or organized participation. Sports have a significant effect on a
        personâ€™s daily life and health, both physical and mental. While you are
        involved in any kind of sports, intense physical activity improves heart
        function, decreases the risk of diabetes, and reduces blood pressure and
        stress levels. Want to know more about the benefits of sports? Stay

      <br />

      <br />
      <div id="cont">
        <h2>1. Control Weight Gain</h2>
        <br />
        One of the major benefits of sporting activities is it helps you to
        control weight gain. A sedentary job and an unhealthy lifestyle are some
        of the main causes of obesity. Obese people have a higher risk of
        hypertension and heart diseases. If obese people involve themselves in
        sports that demand intense physical activity, they can burn more
        calories, shed extra body and reduce the chances of unnecessary weight
        gain. Thus, they can ensure and maintain a good physique. Choosing the
        right sport as per your health conditions and following a balanced diet
        can help individuals control weight gain.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <h2>2. Lower Cholesterol Levels</h2>
        <br />
        Another health benefit of sports is it helps to control cholesterol
        levels. People who are involved in physical activities like sports have
        lower cholesterol levels in comparison to those who do not actively
        participate in sports or other physical activities.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <h2>3. Improve Blood Circulation</h2>
        <br />
        Sport is good for health as it helps to improve blood circulation. Any
        kind of sports game requires active participation, which increases
        haemoglobin and blood volume. Wondering how? When you play any kind of
        sport, your heart pumps faster and puts additional pressure on your
        heart muscles. Thus, this additional pressure strengthens heart muscles
        and improves blood flow.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <h2>4. Reduce Hypertension</h2>
        <br />
        Hypertension or high blood pressure is a major health risk that can
        cause stroke and other heart-related issues. Playing sports helps to
        keep the blood pressure normal. Almost all kinds of sports demands
        running, stretching and other physical activities. When you perform such
        activities, it makes your heart stronger, and the force on arteries
        decreases, which reduces blood pressure. Thus, by participating in
        sports, you can efficiently manage your blood pressure level.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <h2>5. Stronger immunity</h2>
        <br />
        Wondering how sports can ensure stronger immunity? Sports and regular
        exercise improve the White Blood Cells level. White Blood Cells (WBCs)
        are the primary agent of the body that fights disease. Moderate to
        high-intensity exercises improve blood circulation, which enhances the
        immunity system. Sports and regular movement helps to combat pathogens
        and other harmful organisms. Hence, stronger immunity gets into the list
        of health benefits of playing sports.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <h2>6. Stronger Muscles</h2>
        <br />
        If you are willing to have a proper muscle workout, you can get involved
        in sports-related activities. Muscle training activities such as lifting
        weights can help to maintain muscle mass and strength. Further, through
        sports like soccer, tennis, baseball, you can tone your muscles and
        train them to work in a perfect manner. This is known as neuromuscular
        programming. The longer you stay active in sports, the more your muscles
        improve and stay stronger. Also, playing sports help to tone your
        muscles and burn fat simultaneously.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <h2>7. Stronger Bones</h2>
        <br />
        The list of physical benefits of sports for your health includes
        stronger bones. While participating in any kind of sports, you put
        stress on your bones with maximum strength movements, which helps
        increase bone density and make bones stronger. For instance, if you put
        additional stress on bones, the increased level of pressure enables
        bones to adapt to this condition and become denser. Therefore, if you
        continue this intense activity for a long duration, your bones get
        stronger. With advancing age, bone density reduces, but if individuals
        keep themselves involved in light sports, they can maintain a good bone
        density level. Now that you know what the health benefits of sports and
        physical activities are, let us move to the section of mental health
        benefits of sports.

        <div id="incont">
          Similar to physical benefits, sports have an immense effect on mental
          health. Wondering how do sports help you mentally? Read along!

        <br />
        <br />
        <h2>1. Improves Mood</h2>
        <br />
        Playing sports like golf or skiing compels you to concentrate on the
        activities and keep worries aside. As physical activities trigger brain
        chemicals, individuals become happy and relaxed. Hence, sports can
        improve mood.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <h2>2. Reduces Stress</h2>
        <br />
        Today around 75%-90% of people visit a doctor to treat stress-related
        issues. The positive effects of sports on mental health can help
        individuals significantly. Physical activities result in the release of
        endorphins. Endorphins are the chemicals in the brain that help to
        reduce stress and pain. Playing sports also helps to reduce stress
        hormones, cortisol and adrenaline. Studies reveal that 20-30 minutes of
        daily exercise allows individuals to stay calmer, which stays hours
        after exercise.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <h2>3. Combats Depression</h2>
        <br />
        One of the significant effects of sport on mental health is that it
        helps treat depression. As per some studies, sports, i.e. exercises,
        combat symptoms of depression and lower the risk of relapse. Further, in
        one study, light sports or a modest amount of exercise has been seen
        offering similar benefits to antidepressant treatment.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <h2>4. Improves Sleeping Habits</h2>
        <br />
        Sports improve the quality of sleep. An intense workout makes you fall
        asleep faster and also deepens your sleep. For instance, individuals who
        engage in 30 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise can experience better
        sleep compared to days when they did not do exercise.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <h2>5. Boosts Self-Confidence</h2>
        <br />
        Playing sports or participating in regular exercise can help boost
        self-confidence. While you engage in any kind of sport, your strength
        and skills increase; thereby improving your self-confidence. Apart from
        physical and mental benefits, sports can provide you with other benefits
        as well. Willing to know about these in detail? Read along!
